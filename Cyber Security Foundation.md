## Module 1: The fundamentals of cyber security

#### CS breaches and thier impacts
1. Financial cost
2. Legal cost
3. Operatoin cost
4. Loss of intellectual property
5. Reputational damage

#### Threat Landscape
1. Email-realted : Phishing (Unsolicited) / Business email compromise (Gain access to email acc)
2. Malware, Ransomware
3. Cryptojacking

#### Bad actors
: Anybody : Individual, Group, Organization, Country

### Create Cyber Security
- People : Strong password, Best practice
- Processes : Governance, Policies
- Controls : Physical, Logical/Technical, Administrative
<pre>
CIA Traid
- Confidentiality : access control
- Integrity : review, hashing
- Availability : backups
</pre>

## Module 2: The link between information security and governance
<pre>
  ISO 37000 : Intentional standard for good governance
  Purpose
  - Value generation
  - Strategy
  - Oversight
  - Accountability

  CISO : Chief Information Security Officer
</pre>

<pre>
  ISO 27014 : Proper governance of information security ensures its alignment with business obj.
  CISO needs to understand Org Short, Medium, Long term Goals to align their plans with.
  - Operational 0 - 0.5 year
  - Tactical    0.5 - 1 year
  - Strategic   1 - 3 years
</pre>

#### 4 Purposes of IS governance
1. Plan that aligns with Org
2. Calue proposition
3. Take a risk management-based approach
4. Be accountable for assurance performance

#### Roles and Responsibilities
- CISO
- Information security manager
- IT security practitioners

#### Risk and risk management
<pre>
  Asset | Threat Risk | Vulnerability
  Risk Matrix : Impact - Likelihood
  Risk appetite : amount of risk a firm is willing to take
</pre>

#### 4 ways to reponse to risk
<pre>
  1. Mitigate : Decrease the likelihood
  2. Accept
  3. Transfer : Ex. buying insurance
  4. Avoid : Ex. Declind high-risk person to be a customer of a bank
</pre>

## Module 4: Security controls, the Cloud and encryption
#### Cyber security control
<pre>
  - Detective : Identify
  - Preventative : Prevent before they occur
  - Corrective : Reduce the impact
  - Directive : Reduce the likelihood
</pre>

## Cloud computing
<pre>
User's responsibility on Cloud Services
  - SaaS : Data
  - PaaS : Data / Application
  - IaaS : Data / Application / OS

Benefit of Cloud computing
  - Capital Expenditure -> Operation Expenditure
  - Risk reduction
  - Scalability
  - Elasticity
  - Cost
  - Mobility and collaboration
</pre>

## Module 5: Legislation, regulations and standards
1. <strong>Policies</strong> : Briefing clear without too much detail (highest level)
2. <strong>Internal</strong> Standards : Provide more detail about Policies
3. <strong>Procedure</strong> : Explain how we would implement Standards
4. <strong>Guildline</strong> (Optional)

#### Regulation and Legislation
- Legislation : Depends on Jurisdiction
- Regulation : Depends on Industry

## Module 6: Software security lifecycle
: Things will cost more if we don't manage the security at the early development stages.
#### 2 Types of security testing
1. Static : Code review
2. Dynamics : Running the prog for testing

#### Change management, ISMS and independent assurance

## Module 7: Audits, intrusion detection and incident management
: Audit to check security measures
<pre>
  - Internal Audit : Internal
  - 2nd-party Audit : Carried out on suppliers
  - 3rd-party Audit : Carried out for certification
</pre>

#### Intrusion monitoring tools
- Detection : Passive monitoring software monitoring for known attacks.
- Prevention : Actively look for known attacks

#### Security Information and Event Management tool (SIEM)
: Log will always be created 

#### 5 phases of incident management
1. Plan and prepare : Developing policies and plan
2. Detection of suspicious activity
3. Assessment and decision
4. Response and Assure we carry out an appropriate response to the incident
5. Log the lesson
